# My-Coinspot-LOBA
Excel Spreadsheet that connects to a CoinSpot account using API calls

Instead of downloading CSV files from CoinSpot then manually importing them into Excel 
now your trading history will be available in seconds.

Easy setup:

1. Obtain Read-Only API keys from CoinSpot.
2. Open the Spreadsheet
3. Copy & Paste your Read-Only keys into the sheet
4. Press the "Sync Records" button

If your keys work then the spreadsheet macros will download your trading history and fill in seperate
pages with the data. All done in seconds. From there the data is available to create custom reports or 
to analyse.

This Excel spreadsheet contains macros and VBA scripts. It won't work if, for security reasons,
scripts are disabled. Only ever use Read-Only API Keys. Be careful of sharing the spreadsheet if it contains
personal data.
